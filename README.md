# Product-Title-Scraper
When you need to collect the names and brands of all products from 20 different category pages
on an e-commerce website. Normally, you would have to visit each page, scroll down, and manually
copy and paste every single product title into a spreadsheet. This is incredibly time-consuming,
boring, and prone to errors.
This tool solves that problem.
It is a smart script that automatically visits a list of URLs you provide, scrapes all the product titles
and brands from each page (even navigating through multiple pages like "Page 1, 2, 3..."), and
neatly organizes the data for you in a Google Sheet. It acts as your personal data collection
assistant.
